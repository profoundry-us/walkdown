## walkdown

This project's spec is the walkdown blueprint in `blueprint/`. Before building,
testing, or reviewing, read and follow `blueprint/AGENTS.md`.
<!-- walkdown:end -->

## Highball

This repo's rules are enforced locally by Highball: `.highball/checks.yml`,
fired by the Claude Code hooks in `.claude/settings.json` — fast checks after
every edit, the full set at turn end, exit 2 blocking on failure.

Highball and walkdown answer different questions and their records stay
separate. Highball witnesses that the agent followed this repo's rules while
building; walkdown witnesses that the built thing matches its spec. Verdicts
belong in walkdown's runs ledger, never in a Highball run.
